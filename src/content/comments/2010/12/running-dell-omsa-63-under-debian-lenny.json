Couldn't upgrade the whole thing to Squeeze, so this is really nice.<br/><br/> Some notes from my install:<br/> 1. I chose to simply chroot into the dir once I had the basics in there. Saved typing \"chroot /whatever\" before every command.<br/> 2. I had to also install the libsmbios2 package from Ubuntu with the other ones.<br/> 3. Step 10 is a little vague - It should say to chroot into the dir and follow the instructions from Dell's repo (but with the sudos removed).",

Step 8 should also add the Dell apt repository to sources.list.",
