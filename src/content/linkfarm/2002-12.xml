    In an advertising ploy right out of Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report,"
    electronic billboards in the Bay Area and Sacramento are being equipped to
    profile commuters as they whiz by -- and then instantly personalize freeway
    ads based on the wealth and habits of those drivers.

    This is pretty damn cool. I'm usually very concerned about privacy, but
    this seems fine to me since they're only using aggregate info for their
    profiling.

    Why conservatives get a free pass for "treason" -- but liberals don't.
  </description>
  <comment>
    An entry from "Joe Conason's Journal" over on Salon. Why do anti-war
    liberals get labeled as "unpatriotic" by the conservative establishment,
    while anti-war conservatives are quietly, but respectfully, ignored?

    Opinion column on the shortcomings of the modern university as a result

    Wow! A well-written, thought-provoking column appearing in the Daily Cal??
    This paper might have a future yet. Great use of the limited space
    available too.

    Tom Petty is mad as hell and he is not going to take it anymore. He calls
    his new album, "The Last DJ," a "loose concept album" where Petty blasts
    corporate greed in the Clear Channel era of the music business.
  </description>
  <comment>
    Tom Petty is my new hero. He's a major musician who not only talks about
    his distaste for the current music business, but actually acts on it. Now
    if only I liked his music enough to buy the new CD being reviewed in the
    article...

    We've heard it for decades: We're drowning in local television news shows
    that are obsessed with crime and celebrity, the visual and the visceral.
    When a Washington-based news-media think tank released its annual "grades"
    of local TV news in 17 cities earlier this month, it gave each of Southern
    California's three network affiliates low Cs for their 11&#160;p.m.
    newscasts. The Project for Excellence in Journalism criticized the
    stations for relying too heavily on crime stories, failing to do
    sufficient numbers of "enterprise" stories that went beyond daily events
    and lacking a commitment to their communities.

    Concerned about how federal access to their records would undermine
    readers' privacy, thousands of librarians gathered around the country
    to hear televised advice about how to respond to government requests
    under last year's antiterrorism law.
  </description>
  <comment>
    Librarians are the coolest people ever. Their approach is very low-key,
    but they'd probably give up their rights over their dead bodies :) Here's
    a quote: <blockquote>...the fewer records that were kept, the less
    information the government could see. Even necessary records should be
    promptly destroyed after use, they said.</blockquote>

    In allegations likely to further erode Americans' faith in the office of
    the presidency, presidents George Washington through George W. Bush may
    have lied about key matters of national import during their tenures as
    chief executive, an independent-counsel investigation asserted Monday.

    Findings suggest unconscious biases, possibly instilled by the media, can
    shape behavior even when people do not consciously endorse such biases.

    Ikea had a hard time making it in the United States until downwardly
    mobile, upwardly aspiring Americans realized the store could provide them
    a cheap way to live well.

    An analysis of IKEA's success in America. Especially as a result of
    the drastic changes in middle-class taste, which occured in the 1990's.
    This article seems to parallel many of the ideas in "Bobos in Paradise"
    pretty well, like the discussion of the design tastes of the new
    middle class.
